# Use Azure SDKs with a user-assigned Managed Service Identity (MSI)

[!INCLUDE [preview-notice](../../../includes/active-directory-msi-preview-notice-ua.md)]
This article provides a list of SDK samples, which demonstrate use of their respective Azure SDK's support for user-assigned MSI.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [msi-core-prereqs](../../../includes/active-directory-msi-core-prereqs-ua.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - All sample code/script in this article assumes the client is running on an MSI-enabled Virtual Machine. Use the VM "Connect" feature in the Azure portal, to remotely connect to your VM. For details on enabling MSI on a VM, see [Configure a VM Managed Service Identity (MSI) using the Azure CLI](msi-qs-configure-cli-windows-vm.md), or one of the variant articles (using PowerShell, Azure Portal, a template, or an Azure SDK). 

## SDK code samples

| SDK             | Code sample |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| Python          | [Use MSI to authenticate simply from inside a VM](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/samples/resource-manager-python-manage-resources-with-msi/) |
| Ruby            | [Manage resources from an MSI-enabled VM](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/samples/resources-ruby-manage-resources-with-msi/) |

## Next steps
